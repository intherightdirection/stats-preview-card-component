### What I learned

I made the decision to not concentrate on near pixel perfect considering I do not have access to PRO features like figma or sketch layouts.

At this point it's assumed the PRO features have things like specific font sizes, letter spacing and things like that. Without them it's a whole lot of trial and error which takes away from the bigger picture of getting comfortable with CSS. Recognizing things like small design details will probably get somewhat better just from working with CSS a lot. Maybe then I will revisit these projects for new challenge.

My goal is to get comfortable in CSS and I feel I am learning quite a bit and developing a feel. 

I learned how I keep miscalculating percentages from the lengths I am going for and that had to do with the body not being the full length of view port but being short because of border surrounding it.

I learned some more stuff I don't understand about positioning and sizing.

I learned using padding to try and push stuff from edge of container just causes overflow. I need to set widths to allow for padding or margin so they don't cause unintended expansion outside parent container.

### Continued development

Three areas I think I need to go back and put more time into are the box model, positioning and box-sizing.
